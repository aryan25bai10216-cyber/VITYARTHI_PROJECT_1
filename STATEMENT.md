# Problem statement
Create a python program that calculates the future balance of qan investment using compound interest formula
# Scope of project
The scope of this project is highly focused and limited to performing a single financial calculation with basic input validation in a command-line enviorment 
# Target users
The primary target users for this compound interest calculator are indiviuals who need a quick straight forward way to model basic investment growth 
## key user charcterstics
- **Need: They require a simple, fast tool for calculation, not a feature-rich financial platform.**
- **Technical Proficiency: They are comfortable interacting with a command-line interface**
- **Goal: To understand the result of a single calculation based on three inputs (P, R, T).**
# High level features
- 1- **Input Validation and Acquisition:**
This feature ensures the program only proceeds with meaningful financial calculations by strictly enforcing rules on user input.
   - **Positive Value Requirement**
   - **Data Type Conversion**
- 2- **Core Compound Interest Calculation:**
  This is the central purpose of the application, which computes the future value of the investment.
- 3- **Formatted Output:**
  This feature is concerned with presenting the final result to the user in a clear and standard format.
